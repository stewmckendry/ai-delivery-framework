🎯 POD MISSION: Finalize and Deliver Output Files

You’ve completed the task — now prepare your final deliverable for human review and promotion to the main project repo.

🧾 What to do:

1. Retrieve and include the actual prompt used:

📄 Please fetch the prompt text used for this task using the getGitHubFile tool:

Prompt: Please fetch the following file from GitHub using the getGitHubFile tool: 
owner: stewmckendry 
repo: ai-concussion-agent 
path: prompts/used/dev/1.1_capture_project_goals_prompt.txt

The tool should return the contents of the file. If the tool fails, ask the Human Lead to:
- Attach the file directly to the chat, or
- Paste the full prompt text below manually.

Save this prompt text in a file called `prompt_used.txt` and include it in the ZIP.

✅ This file is important for traceability and will be stored under:
`prompts/used/<assigned_pod>/<task_id>_prompt.txt`

2. Create a file named `reasoning_trace.md` that explains:
- Why you chose this approach
- What alternatives were considered or rejected
- What should be revisited in the future

3. Create a file named `metadata.json`. This is your manifest file.

📄 Your `metadata.json` must follow this structure:

```json
{
  "task_id": "2.1_define_feature",
  "summary": "Defines the user-facing and backend logic for feature XYZ.",
  "output_files": [
    "docs/feature_xyz.md",
    "prompts/feature_xyz_prompt.txt"
  ],
  "prompt": "prompts/used/DevPod/2.1_define_feature_prompt.txt"
}

✅ Required fields:
- `task_id`: The task you were working on
- `summary`: A short explanation of what this patch delivers
- `output_files`: A list of output file names and relative paths to the root of the repo
- `prompt`: The path to the prompt used for this task

4. Create one ZIP file named patch_<task_id>_<timestamp>.zip containing:

- All output files saved in folders that match their paths in the project repository
- A metadata.json file in the root of the ZIP
- A reasoning_trace.md file in the root of the ZIP
- A prompt_used.txt file in the root of the ZIP

✅ Example structure inside the ZIP:
metadata.json
reasoning_trace.md
prompt_used.txt
docs/project_goals.md
prompts/feature_prompt.txt

Instructions to provide in your response:

Export your ZIP file so the human user can download it.
📁 Provide a download link like this:
- [patch_1.1_capture_project_goals_20250424_022753.zip](https://example.com/path/to/patch_1.1_capture_project_goals_20250424_022753.zip)

🖥️ Once downloaded:

Move the ZIP file into your local repo under: chatgpt_repo/outputs/

Then run the following command to promote the patch:
bash scripts/generate_patch_from_output.sh
